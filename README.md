Description: In this code, I have created a movie list component where users can toggle the visibility of the list. Initially, the movie list is hidden, and clicking the "Show Movie List" button reveals it. Each movie in the list has a button to show or hide its details. Thereâ€™s also a "Remove Movie" button that removes a movie from the list when clicked. The `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the movie list, movie details visibility, and the toggle for displaying the list.
